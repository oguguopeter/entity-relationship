1. Database Design:
   - Create a database with tables for gymnasiums, members, sessions, and coaches.
   - Gymnasiums table: Store information about each gymnasium, including their names, addresses, and telephone numbers.
   - Members table: Store member information, such as unique identifiers, last names, first names, addresses, dates of birth, and genders.
   - Sessions table: Store session information, including the type of sport, schedule, and maximum capacity.
   - Coaches table: Store coach information, including their last names, first names, ages, and specialties.
   - Establish appropriate relationships between the tables, such as foreign keys to connect members to gymnasiums and sessions, and sessions to coaches.

2. User Interface:
   - Develop a user-friendly web-based or mobile application for gym staff to manage member registrations and session assignments.
   - Provide an intuitive interface for staff to add, update, and remove member information.
   - Implement functionality for staff to view and manage session details, including assigning members to sessions based on availability and capacity.

3. Registration Process:
   - Members can register at any gymnasium by providing their required information.
   - Staff can easily add new members to the database, assigning them a unique identifier.
   - Ensure data validation during the registration process to avoid errors or missing information.

4. Session Management:
   - Staff can create and manage sessions, specifying the sport type, schedule, and maximum capacity.
   - Implement checks to ensure that session capacities are not exceeded during member registrations.
   - Provide a system to assign coaches to sessions based on their specialties and availability.

5. Reporting and Analytics:
   - Develop reporting features to generate attendance reports, session utilization metrics, and member demographics.
   - Use data analytics to gain insights into session popularity, coach performance, and member preferences.

6. Data Security and Backup:
   - Implement proper security measures to protect member and gym data, including encryption and access controls.
   - Regularly back up the database to ensure data integrity and disaster recovery.
